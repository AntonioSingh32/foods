# Project 3 - *Yelp App*

**Yelp App** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [ ] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Better ways to implement search results
2. How to get more stored API data than what we have

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
